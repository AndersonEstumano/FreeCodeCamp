        <p>Since its creation, C++ has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Well-written C++ programs are fast and efficient. The language is more flexible than other languages: It can work at the highest levels of abstraction, and down at the level of the silicon. C++ supplies highly optimized standard libraries. It enables access to low-level hardware features, to maximize speed and minimize memory requirements. C++ can create almost any kind of program: Games, device drivers, HPC, cloud, desktop, embedded, and mobile apps, and much more. Even libraries and compilers for other programming languages get written in C++.

</p>
        <p>One of the original requirements for C++ was backward compatibility with the C language. As a result, C++ has always permitted C-style programming, with raw pointers, arrays, null-terminated character strings, and other features. They may enable great performance, but can also spawn bugs and complexity. The evolution of C++ has emphasized features that greatly reduce the need to use C-style idioms. The old C-programming facilities are still there when you need them. However, in modern C++ code you should need them less and less. Modern C++ code is simpler, safer, more elegant, and still as fast as ever.</p>
        <p>The following sections provide an overview of the main features of modern C++. Unless noted otherwise, the features listed here are available in C++11 and later. In the Microsoft C++ compiler, you can set the /std compiler option to specify which version of the standard to use for your project.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Resources_and_smart_pointers">
        <header>Resources and smart pointers</header>
        <p>One of the major classes of bugs in C-style programming is the memory leak. Leaks are often caused by a failure to call <strong>delete</strong> for memory that was allocated with <strong>new</strong>. Modern C++ emphasizes the principle of resource acquisition is initialization (RAII). The idea is simple. Resources (heap memory, file handles, sockets, and so on) should be owned by an object. That object creates, or receives, the newly allocated resource in its constructor, and deletes it in its destructor. The principle of RAII guarantees that all resources get properly returned to the operating system when the owning object goes out of scope.</p>
        <p>To support easy adoption of RAII principles, the C++ Standard Library provides three smart pointer types: std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr. A smart pointer handles the allocation and deletion of the memory it owns. The following example shows a class with an array member that is allocated on the heap in the call to make_unique(). The calls to <strong>new</strong> and <strong>delete</strong> are encapsulated by the unique_ptr class. When a widget object goes out of scope, the unique_ptr destructor will be invoked and it will release the memory that was allocated for the array.</p>
        <article>
          <code>
            #include <memory>
class widget
{
private:
    std::unique_ptr<int[]> data;
public:
    widget(const int size) { data = std::make_unique<int[]>(size); }
    void do_something() {}
};

void functionUsingWidget() {
    widget w(1000000);  // lifetime automatically tied to enclosing scope
                        // constructs w, including the w.data gadget member
    // ...
    w.do_something();
    // ...
} // automatic destruction and deallocation for w and w.data
          </code>
        </article>
        <p>Whenever possible, use a smart pointer to manage heap memory. If you must use the new and delete operators explicitly, follow the principle of RAII. For more information, see Object lifetime and resource management (RAII).</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="std::string_and_std::string_view">
        <header>std::string and std::string_view</header>
        <p>C-style strings are another major source of bugs. By using std::string and std::wstring, you can eliminate virtually all the errors associated with C-style strings. You also gain the benefit of member functions for searching, appending, prepending, and so on. Both are highly optimized for speed. When passing a string to a function that requires only read-only access, in C++17 you can use std::string_view for even greater performance benefit.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="std::vector_and_other_Standard_Library_containers">
        <header>std::vector and other Standard Library containers</header>
        <p>The standard library containers all follow the principle of RAII. They provide iterators for safe traversal of elements. And, they're highly optimized for performance and have been thoroughly tested for correctness. By using these containers, you eliminate the potential for bugs or inefficiencies that might be introduced in custom data structures. Instead of raw arrays, use vector as a sequential container in C++.</p>
        <code>
          vector<string> apples;
apples.push_back("Granny Smith");
        </code>
        <p>Use map (not unordered_map) as the default associative container. Use set, multimap, and multiset for degenerate and multi cases.</p>
        <code>
          map<string, string> apple_color;
// ...
apple_color["Granny Smith"] = "Green";
        </code>
        <ul>When performance optimization is needed, consider using:

<li>The array type when embedding is important, for example, as a class member.</li>

<li>Unordered associative containers such as unordered_map. These have lower per-element overhead and constant-time lookup, but they can be harder to use correctly and efficiently.</li>

<li>Sorted vector. For more information, see Algorithms.</li>

<p>Don't use C-style arrays. For older APIs that need direct access to the data, use accessor methods such as f(vec.data(), vec.size()); instead. For more information about containers, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/stl-containers?view=msvc-170">C++ Standard Library Containers</a>.</p>

        <header>Standard Library algorithms</header>
        <p>Before you assume that you need to write a custom algorithm for your program, first review the C++ Standard Library algorithms. The Standard Library contains an ever-growing assortment of algorithms for many common operations such as searching, sorting, filtering, and randomizing. The math library is extensive. In C++17 and later, parallel versions of many algorithms are provided.</p>

<ul>Here are some important examples:

<li>for_each, the default traversal algorithm (along with range-based for loops).</li>

<li>transform, for not-in-place modification of container elements</li>

<li>find_if, the default search algorithm.</li>

<li>sort, lower_bound, and the other default sorting and searching algorithms.</li>

<p>To write a comparator, use strict < and use named lambdas when you can.</p>
<code>
  auto comp = [](const widget& w1, const widget& w2)
     { return w1.weight() < w2.weight(); }

sort( v.begin(), v.end(), comp );

auto i = lower_bound( v.begin(), v.end(), widget{0}, comp );
</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="auto_instead_of_explicit_type_names">
        <header>auto instead of explicit type names</header>
        <p>C++11 introduced the auto keyword for use in variable, function, and template declarations. auto tells the compiler to deduce the type of the object so that you don't have to type it explicitly. auto is especially useful when the deduced type is a nested template:</p>
        <code>
          map<int,list<string>>::iterator i = m.begin(); // C-style
auto i = m.begin(); // modern C++
        </code>
